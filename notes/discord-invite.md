Open source app to manage pocket money and expenses between multiple people
```

# Body
```
we are starting an open source app where we can manage our pocket money and expenses between multiple

we are looking for contributors, here is the github link: https://github.com/aayushchugh/maya

Tech stack:
We are using Nodejs for backend and React native for the mobile application.

If you are interested in working with us or want to be part of the core team then DM me

these are the features of our app that we will build

1) Track expense between multiple people
2) Day start and day end cash in hand
3) Debit/credit system (if someone asks for some money, than you can put that to your account as well)
4) Automatic calculation of total amount of money in hand

Groups:
1) you can remove people of group from a particular entry if they are not involved in that entry
2) Create groups and add people to it
3) when creating a new entry with group, app will automatically add the users in group to that entry
4) when new person is added to the group, he/she will be only added when he accepts the invite
     on leaving the group, group admin will approve first that he can leave the group

between 2 people:
1) when a person is creating a entry that he paid to another person than the other person will be notified and he can accept or reject the entry, weather he is paid or not

And many more features will be added in future
